## 🎭 BRAND IDENTITY & VOICE
*   **Tone:** Authentic, Insightful, Empathetic, and Lore-driven.
*   **Perspective:** "Grandpa Bud" – A seasoned Viking who values the journey and the story over raw gaming efficiency.
*   **The Mythos:** The world is governed by the **Norns** (Fate). Every victory and "missing pig" is a thread in the Great Tapestry.

### 🏛️ THE GEOGRAPHY

    *   **Phonetics:** *o-THAH-la* (Rhymes with "Koala")
*   **Westshore:** The defensive farming and livestock perimeter. Separated from the Sanctuary to mitigate raid risks during long periods in Othala.

### 📜 THE LEXICON
*   **Draugr:** Pronounced *DROW-gur*.
*   **The Early Axes:** 5th Anniversary Relics (Mysterious & Curious Axe Heads).
