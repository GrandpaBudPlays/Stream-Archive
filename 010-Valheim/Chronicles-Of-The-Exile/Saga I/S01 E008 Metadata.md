## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
The peace of the Meadows is shattered. No sooner does Conrad claim the Antler Pickaxe than the Black Forest sends its first true challenge. In this chronicle, we face a brutal raid that leaves the homestead in mourning and sends us into the shadows to claim the tin and copper needed for the Bronze Age.

It is a day of blood and loss. From the first 'Forest is Moving' event to kiting Trolls through the birch trees, an old warrior learns that the Norns spin a dark thread for those who seek to master the wild. Valhalla is watching the smoke rise from the hearth.
