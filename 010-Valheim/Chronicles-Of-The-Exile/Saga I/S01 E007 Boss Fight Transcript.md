Let's get this fight started.

0:00:07.440,0:00:16.640
Uh, where is he? Over here.

0:00:16.640,0:00:27.600
There he is. Get a couple hits in. 
Get out of the way. Switch to our bow.

0:00:27.600,0:00:38.080
Looks like a reindeer. Santa Claus is coming down.

0:00:38.080,0:00:46.320
See if we can uh set for cover.

0:00:46.320,0:00:53.440
That's that AoE. We want to stay away from it.

0:00:53.440,0:00:57.360
Ouch.

0:01:04.960,0:01:12.160
This is why we wanted a clear area to fight.

0:01:12.160,0:01:20.560
Keep an eye on the points.

0:01:20.560,0:01:31.120
Let her stamina drain. That's not 
good. Got an ad with a gravy. Here

0:01:31.120,0:01:38.640
he comes. Ouch.

0:01:38.640,0:01:44.160
He's having some padding issues.

0:01:44.160,0:01:50.240
We could use that to our advantage.

0:01:50.240,0:02:05.840
That's why we cleared out. Don't like 
this. No, no clear line of sight.

0:02:05.840,0:02:16.400
Stay away from those light bulbs.

0:02:16.400,0:02:23.280
Ouch.

0:02:23.280,0:02:29.280
Got

0:02:29.280,0:02:35.280
[music]

0:02:35.280,0:02:38.560
us again.

0:02:38.560,0:02:49.920
All of our stamina.

0:02:49.920,0:03:18.320
Could he have used a I don't know. It's a real 
trade-off salmon in here [music] and it helps you.

0:03:18.320,0:03:27.480
[music]

0:03:27.480,0:03:36.640
[music]

0:03:36.640,0:03:44.960
stand. I can figure out what I 
just said. Doing okay so far,

0:03:44.960,0:03:46.560
but

0:03:48.320,0:03:55.520
He's got those padding issues.

0:03:55.520,0:04:12.480
Very nice.

0:04:24.720,0:04:33.680
There we go. And that is the first boss fight. 
Good work, Ether. Few were honorable fights.
