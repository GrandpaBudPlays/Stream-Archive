## ✨ SURVIVAL WISDOM & HIGHLIGHT GOLD
[02:21] - Action/Drama: A Brutal Raid—the "Forest is Moving" event serves as a grim reminder that no base is ever truly safe.

[06:47] - Character Moment: Farewells to the Boars—the emotional cost of the raid adds narrative weight to the survival experience.

## 🎙️ COMMENTARY & SPEAKER GROWTH
### Areas for Improvement:

* **Death Narratives:** After the "mortal blow," there was a brief moment of frustration. While natural, try to frame these setbacks as "The Norns spinning a dark thread" immediately to keep the audience in the story world.

* **Clarity in Combat:** During the "Troll Trick" with the birch trees, the action was fast. Narrating exactly what you want the Troll to hit would help viewers follow your clever strategy more easily.

### Areas of Growth:

* **Emotional Resonance:** Your "Farewell to the Boars" after the raid was the strongest character moment in the series so far. It showcased the "Deeply Devoted Family Man" trait, even toward his livestock.

* **Tactical Brilliance:** Using the Troll to gather Fine Wood is the ultimate "Elder's Wisdom." It’s practical, slightly dangerous, and very memorable.
