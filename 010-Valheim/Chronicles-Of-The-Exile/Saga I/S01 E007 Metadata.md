## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
A warrior’s victory is won long before the first blow is struck. Conrad spends these final hours in the Meadows honoring the old ways—tending the hearth, taming the wild boars of the field, and meticulously outfitting himself for the trial ahead.

From the careful fletching of arrows to the construction of a tactical sanctuary near the Great Stag’s altar, every action is a prayer for survival. Watch as the preparation meets the storm in a thunderous confrontation with Eikthyr. With the claiming of the Antler Pickaxe, the first chapter of the exile ends, and the stone of the earth will finally yield to our will. Valhalla is watching.

Here is a link to the my favorite storage layout that I mentioned. I admire the attention to detail that PHINQS put into his work. Nothing like the sloppy stuff I do.

I love his Efficient Stone Base. I used his design in one of my worlds and really like his design.
