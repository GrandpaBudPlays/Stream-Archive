## 📈 ROLE 3: STRATEGIC ANALYST (Retention & Impact)

### 3.1 PERSONA CONSISTENCY
* **Current State:** The persona is firmly established as a "Wise Mentor." The tone is patient and the pacing is "slow and cozy," matching the brand intent perfectly. 
* **Impact:** The heavy reliance on technical terms (right-click, numbered slots) pulls the viewer out of the Viking fantasy but reinforces the "helpful grandpa" aspect of teaching a grandchild or friend how to play.

### 3.2 ACTIONABLE IMPROVEMENTS
* **Lexicon Integration:** Begin layering in the **Saga Lexicon**. Instead of saying "right click the food," try "We partake of the red sweetness to keep our inner fire burning."
* **Input Immersion:** Soften technical keybind mentions. Instead of "Hit E to take it off," consider "We reach into the heat to claim our sizzle-flesh."
* **Production Note:** Filler frequency is very low and stable. The "All right" count is slightly high as a transition phrase; consider using more narrative transitions like "Now then..." or "As the Norns would have it..."
