## 🎨 ROLE 2: CREATIVE DIRECTOR (Narrative & Persona)

### 1. Lexicon Saturation Audit
* **Lexicon Use:** 0% (Transcript relies entirely on modern gaming terminology).
* **Missed Opportunities:**
    * Used **"Raspberries"** [0:09:09] instead of **"The Red Sweetness"**.
    * Used **"Seeds"** [0:01:52] instead of **"The Norns' Threads"**.
    * Used **"World"** [0:00:22] instead of **"The Tenth Realm"**.

### 2. Grandpa Rule Evaluation
* **Plain Speech:** Excellent. Explanations of "seeds" and "character creation" are clear and accessible without using jargon.
* **Helpful Guidance:** Strong. Provides immediate value regarding food/stamina management: "raspberries will provide us with 20 stamina" [0:09:21].

## 📈 ROLE 3: STRATEGIC ANALYST (Retention & Impact)

### 1. Persona Consistency
* **Current State:** The "Grandpa" persona is leaning heavily into the "Technical Tutor" role. While helpful, it lacks the "Exile Lore" flavoring needed to distinguish it from standard tutorials.
* **Impact:** High clarity for beginners, but low immersion for viewers seeking a saga-like experience.

### 2. Actionable Improvements
* **Integration:** Transition from explaining the "World Generator" to discussing the "Will of the Norns."
* **Immediate Correction:** Replace UI-specific terms like "Stamina Bar" with "Inner Fire" or "Breath" to align with the Saga Lexicon while maintaining helpfulness.
* **Pacing:** Filler frequency is within acceptable bounds, but the "Um" count increases during technical menus. Pre-scripting technical explanations would reduce this.
