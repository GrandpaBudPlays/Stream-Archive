## 📈 ROLE 3: STRATEGIC ANALYST (Retention & Impact)

### 3.1 PERSONA CONSISTENCY
* **Current State:** The "Helpful Grandpa" persona is dominant and highly effective. The pacing is "slow and cozy," which aligns with the brand vision of a retirement experiment.
* **Impact:** High educational value for viewers. The technical modernisms (mouse clicks) break immersion but increase the utility of the guide for actual new players.

### 3.2 ACTIONABLE IMPROVEMENTS
* **Immersive Instruction:** To maintain the "Grandpa" vibe while improving immersion, bridge the gap between technical and narrative. Instead of "Right click to block," try: "Now, a firm grip on your shield—what the folks call a right-click—will stop a blow dead in its tracks".
* **Vocabulary Expansion:** Start introducing "The Shadow-Garth" and "The Storm-Stag" into the early-episode goal setting to set the mythological stakes.
* **Technical Note:** Filler word frequency is consistent with previous episodes. The use of "So" as a transition is becoming a verbal habit; utilizing narrative "hooks" (e.g., "The Norns have seen fit to...") would improve the flow.
