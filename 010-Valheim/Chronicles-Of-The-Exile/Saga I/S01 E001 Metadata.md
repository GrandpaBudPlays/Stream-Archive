## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
The Valkyrie’s wings were the last thing I saw before the Great Green swallowed me whole. My pockets were empty. My hands were cold. But the Allfather doesn't send us to the Tenth World for a vacation.

Conrad has arrived—red hair, a stout mustache, and a long road of exile ahead of him. In this first chronicle, we land in the Meadows with nothing but our wits. Survival here isn't about being a hero; it's about preparation. We meet the raven, Hugin, locate the altar of the first beast, and race against the sun to put a roof over our heads. The Meadows may look peaceful, but the night has teeth.

The Elder’s Lessons:

The Foundation: You cannot build a saga without first gathering the sticks and stones at your feet. Every great hall starts as a pile of rubble.

The Sun’s Mercy: In the Tenth World, daylight is a gift. When the shadows stretch, you’d best have a hearth and a door between you and the forest.

A Simple Defense: A wooden club might not look like much in the songs of old, but it is the difference between finding a meal and becoming one for the boars.

The mead is cold. The hearth is warm. The saga continues. I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim.
Have a good one.
