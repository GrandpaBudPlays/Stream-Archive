## ✨ SURVIVAL WISDOM & HIGHLIGHT GOLD
[00:00] - Survival Wisdom: Understanding world modifiers is the first step to mastery; knowing the "laws" of your seed prevents unexpected difficulty spikes.

[13:52] - Highlight Gold: Spotting a Rare Two-Star Boar—a critical moment for long-term survival, as high-tier livestock provides significantly more resources.

[17:45] - Survival Wisdom: Mastery of the Shield Parry—learning the timing to stagger enemies is the difference between a quick victory and a slow death.

[24:29] - Survival Wisdom: The Waystation—never explore deep into new territory without building a temporary shelter for a quick respawn point.

## 🎙️ COMMENTARY & SPEAKER GROWTH

### Areas for Improvement:

* **Technical Density:** The first 8 minutes focused on world modifiers are very information-heavy. Breaking these up with a bit more "Conrad" flavor—perhaps how these "laws of the Norns" affect an old man's bones—would help maintain immersion.

* **Audio Levels:** There are moments when the "Sting of the Wild" (bees) almost drowns out your commentary. Watching the balance during high-SFX moments will help vocal clarity.

### Areas of Growth:

* **Educational Value:** The "Combat Class" on the shield parry is excellent. It fulfills the brand promise of providing "Elder's Wisdom" while showing tactical competence.

* **Pacing:** You did a great job managing the "10-Meter Wilderness" segment, keeping the tension high despite the small area.
