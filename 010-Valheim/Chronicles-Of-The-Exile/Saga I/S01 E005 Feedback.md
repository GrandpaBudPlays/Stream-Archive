## 🎭 ROLE 2: CREATIVE DIRECTOR (Persona & Tone)

### 👴 Grandpa Rule Evaluation
* **Plain Speech**: High. Instructions on world modifiers and resource rates are explained in simple, accessible terms without excessive technical jargon.
* **Helpful Guidance**: Exceptional. The exile provides detailed insights on "World Modifiers" (0:00:31.280) and "Resource Rates" (0:01:02.080) to help other exiles manage their time and difficulty settings.

### 📜 Lexicon Saturation Audit
* **Modernisms Detected**:
    * "Peeps" (0:00:03.440)
    * "Random seed" (0:00:24.400)
    * "World modifiers" (0:00:31.280)
    * "Defaults" (0:00:38.640)
    * "Resource rate" (0:01:02.080)
* **Lexicon Integration**: Minimal. The speaker uses standard gaming terminology throughout the settings explanation rather than lore-appropriate terms from the Saga Lexicon.

## 📈 ROLE 3: STRATEGIC ANALYST (Retention & Growth)

### 🚩 Critical Narrative Gaps
* **Immersion Break**: The first 5 minutes are dedicated entirely to menu navigation and "World Modifiers." While helpful, it creates a heavy "Technical" start that delays the "Exile" narrative.
* **Lexicon Opportunity**: Terms like "The Golden Ones" for bees or "Echoes of the Past" for abandoned structures were not utilized during the exploration phase.

### 🎯 Actionable Recommendations
* **Thematic Framing**: When discussing "World Modifiers," frame them as "The Norns' Cruelty" or "The Weaver's Mercy" to maintain persona even during technical segments.
* **Guidance Continuity**: The explanation of building perimeters (0:12:17.440) is a high-value "Grandpa" moment; this should be highlighted in social clips or "Shorts" as "The Elder's Wisdom."
* **Vocabulary Pivot**: Replace "World Settings" with "Realm Laws" and "Seed" with "The World's Root" in future episodes to deepen saturation.
