### 🎨 ROLE 2: CREATIVE DIRECTOR
**"The Weaver of the Exile’s Tale"**

* **Grandpa Rule Evaluation:**
    * **Plain Speech:** High. The dialogue is direct and functional, avoiding overly complex jargon while explaining game mechanics (e.g., explaining the workbench perimeter at 0:12:17.440).
    * **Helpful Guidance:** Strong. The exile provides clear insights on building constraints, such as standing on the edge of a perimeter to build outside it.
* **Lexicon Saturation:**
    * **Modernisms Detected:** "Valheim" (0:00:02.400), "Random seed" (0:00:12.080), "Crafting table" (0:12:35.840), "Hours" (0:00:26.160).
    * **Lexicon Integration:** Very Low. The speaker relies almost entirely on modern gaming terminology rather than Saga Lexicon alternatives like "Othala" or "Shadow-Garth Forge".
* **Tone Consistency:** Consistent "Helpful Elder" persona. The exile uses a calm, instructional tone suitable for guiding other survivors through the Meadows.

### 📈 ROLE 3: STRATEGIC ANALYST
**"The Seer of the Path Ahead"**

* **Critical Content Gaps:**
    * **Immersion Break:** The frequent use of technical terms ("26 degree roof," "random seed") pulls the listener out of the "Exile" narrative and into a "Gamer" perspective.
    * **Missed Lore Opportunities:** Locations like the "Echoes of the Past" (Abandoned Villages) or "The Hearth's Embrace" (Warmth/Shelter) could be used to replace technical descriptions of houses and fire.
* **Actionable Recommendations:**
    * **Lexicon Pivot:** Replace "Crafting Table" with "Shadow-Garth Forge" and "Valheim" with "The Tenth Realm" to deepen the Saga atmosphere.
    * **Guidance Enhancement:** Continue the "Helpful Guidance" by framing tips as "Lessons learned from the Norns" rather than technical game mechanics.
    * **Filler Reduction:** While the frequency is low, reducing "Um" during building sequences will maintain the authoritative "Grandpa" persona.
