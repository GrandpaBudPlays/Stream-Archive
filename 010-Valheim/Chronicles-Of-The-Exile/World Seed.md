# The Elder's Invitations
1. I'm just an old man stumbling through the brush, but I’d be honored to hear if your journey in this world proves more prosperous than mine.
2. If you decide to settle in these same Meadows, leave a word at the hearth and tell me where you decided to raise your roof.
3. Odin watches every exile. Take this seed for yourself and let me know if the Great Green was more merciful to you than it was to poor Conrad.
