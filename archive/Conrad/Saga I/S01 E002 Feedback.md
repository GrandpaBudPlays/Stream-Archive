# Audit Report: S01 E002

## 1. SPEECH METRICS
* **Filler Word Count:** 
  * 24 instances of "So" (predominantly used as a transition between gameplay tasks) 
  * 18 instances of "Uh/Um."
* **Thematic Pauses:** [01:35] - Transition into the game could benefit from a silent beat rather than "So, let's start." [05:44] - A pause after discussing the bed icon would reinforce the "Steady Elder" persona.
* **Vocal Clarity & Presence:** [10:01] - Commentary regarding low visibility in-game matches a slight drop in vocal projection, which feels authentic to the environment.

## 2. PERSONA & IMMERSION CHECK
* **Persona Breaks:** [04:47] - Mention of "spoilers" is a modern content creator term. [18:43] - "In case" (referring to future game updates/mechanics) leans slightly technical.
* **Ulf Rule Adherence:** * *Critique:* [02:59] "This is going to give us a high health food source that we can eat to improve our overall health." (Too wordy).
    * *Fix:* "Good meat makes for a strong heart. Eat well to live long."

## 3. LINGUISTIC AUDIT
* **Lexicon Usage:** Used "Meadows" and "Black Forest" (Technical). Missed opportunity to use "The Great Green" or "Othala" for the abandoned village.
* **Kenning Opportunity:** [07:14] Instead of "raspberries," consider "The Weaver’s Fruit" or "Hearth-Sweets."
* **Elder’s Wisdom Hook:** [02:59] Successfully explained the food system. [14:52] Effectively taught the "Reading the Heavens" time-telling trick.

## 4. ARCHIVAL LOG
* **[02:10] - The Hearth’s Spit:** Building the cooking station and explaining food mechanics.
* **[04:13] - The Weaver’s Diet:** Breaking down the Red, White, and Yellow food system.
* **[07:56] - Setting the Compass:** Beginning the westward trek toward the Black Forest.
* **[14:52] - Reading the Heavens:** Using the sun and mini-map to determine time of day.
* **[30:38] - The Flint Edge:** Crafting the flint axe and discussing weapon upgrades.

## 🎞️ UPDATED VIDEO DESCRIPTION (STATE 2)

The sun rises on a new day. My belly is empty, but the hearth is ready. A man cannot walk the path to the Black Forest on an empty stomach. I have found the red berries and the white mushrooms. Now, I seek the flint by the water's edge.

The Allfather’s judgment is final. Conrad stands as a ghost in the Tenth World, proving his worth in a land that remembers neither his name nor his steel.

In this chronicle, we join the Exile as he masters the art of the cooking spit and strikes out westward. We explore the ruins of those who came before and learn to read the sun’s path to find our way home. The journey to the Black Forest has truly begun.
