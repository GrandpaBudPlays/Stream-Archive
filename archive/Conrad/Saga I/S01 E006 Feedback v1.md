## ✨ SURVIVAL WISDOM & HIGHLIGHT GOLD
[14:20] - Highlight Gold: The Great Boar Drive—a masterclass in patience, demonstrating that animal husbandry is as vital as combat for a permanent homestead.

[47:54] - Action/Drama: Braving the Burial Chambers—the shift in atmosphere from the sunny Meadows to the dark, skeleton-filled halls is palpable.

[1:04:06] - Character Moment: The "Silent Celebration"—after finding enough Surtling Cores for a kiln, Conrad’s quiet satisfaction is more impactful than a loud cheer.

[1:07:57] - Action/Drama: The Chase—narrowly outrunning a Forest Giant (Troll) in the dark highlights the ongoing danger of the early game.

## 🎙️ COMMENTARY & SPEAKER GROWTH
### Areas for Improvement:

* **Self-Correction Loops:** You mentioned re-watching your videos to see "how bad" you’re doing. While humble, be careful not to break the "Conrad" immersion too much by being overly self-critical. The "Grandpa" persona should be confident in his steady pace.

* **Navigation Awareness:** Waking up outside the house was a funny moment, but there was a brief period of confusion regarding the door location. Use those moments to lean into a "Grumpy Grandpa" comment about building in the dark.

### Areas of Growth:

* **Format Mastery:** Increasing the recording length to over an hour was the right call. It allowed the "Burial Chamber" run to feel like a complete narrative arc rather than a cliffhanger.

* **Character Depth:** The "Silent Celebration" after finding Surtling Cores is peak Brand Alignment. It shows that Conrad’s victories are internal and stoic.
