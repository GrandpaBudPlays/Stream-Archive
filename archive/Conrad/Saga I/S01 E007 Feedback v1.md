## 🎙️ COMMENTARY & SPEAKER GROWTH
### Areas for Improvement:

* **Repetitive Fillers:** During the "March to the Altar," there's a slight uptick in "uh" and "um" as you navigate. This is a common habit during movement, but focusing on steady breaths or "yups" can keep it in character.

* **Inventory Management:** The "Burden of Loot" segment ran a bit long. You can use these moments to tell a quick "Grandpa story" or reflection to keep the energy up while sorting items.

### Areas of Growth:

* **Narrative Prep:** The "Ritual of Readiness" at the altar was fantastic. You didn't just fight a boss; you told a story of a warrior preparing for a spiritual trial.

* **Community Building:** Giving a shout-out to other creators like PHINQS while discussing storage layouts reinforces the "wholesome" side of the brand.
