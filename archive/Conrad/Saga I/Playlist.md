## 📜 PLAYLIST DESCRIPTION
The Allfather dropped Conrad into the Meadows with nothing but a grey sky and a heavy burden. Here, the task is simple but grueling: prove that an old man can still tame the wild. This is where the foundation of the saga is laid—one stone, one branch, and one prayer at a time. If Conrad cannot survive the peace of the Meadows, he has no hope for the trials ahead. The journey from exile begins here.

Welcome to the Tenth World. I am Grandpa Bud, and these are the chronicles of my exile. Whether I am wandering the Meadows alone or teaching the next generation to survive, every video is a thread in the great tapestry woven by the Norns.

In this series, you’ll find:
Practical tips for new and veteran Vikings (parrying, building, and resource management).
A slow-paced, immersive journey through the biomes of Valheim.
My reflections on the world, the gods, and the fate that binds us.

Grab a horn of mead, sit by the hearth, and join the journey. Subscribe to follow the saga as it unfolds.
