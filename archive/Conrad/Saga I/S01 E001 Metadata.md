## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
They sent Conrad to the 10th World with nothing but the rags on his back and the call of the ravens in his ears. His quest is simple: slay the Forsaken or be forever exiled from the halls of Valhalla. He’s an old man in a young man's game, but he’s got the patience of the forest and the iron will of the North.
Today, the trial begins in the Meadows. We build, we hunt, and we take our first steps toward proving to Odin that Conrad is worthy of the high seat.
