## 📜 YouTube DESCRIPTION
The silence of the Meadows is broken. To prove his worth to the Allfather, Conrad must face Eikthyr—the massive cosmic stag that stands between an exiled warrior and his survival.

This is more than a hunt; it is a ritual of blood and lightning.

Though Conrad’s journey through the Meadows is still unfolding (see the Chronicles of the Exiled playlist below), the Norns have offered us a glimpse into his future trial. May the thunder guide his shield.
