Junk from transitioning away from Brand-Context. This needs to be migrated to other areas.

Move the "Mandatory Tagging List" and "Hugin Perspective" into your new .gemini/styleguide.md.

Where is State 2 Narritive Logic Defined


1. Updating Your AI Knowledge
To ensure the AI knows exactly when and how to use these links, you should update your .gemini/styleguide.md (or your AI-Operations.md) with the following logic:

A. New Live Stream Draft Protocol
Trigger: When the user provides goals for a future stream (e.g., "Conrad is going to try to find iron"). AI Action:

Generate Title: Create a compelling, non-clickbait title.

Narrative Hook: Write 3-5 sentences in the Grandpa Bud voice (Ulf Rule) describing the intent.

Insert Links: Locate the Standard-Links.md file and insert the link block corresponding to the current Biome.

Format for OBS: Provide the output as a clean block ready for copy-pasting.

## Conrad's Silver Forging Priority (90 Ingot Budget)

Since Conrad is already swinging **Frostner**, the priority shifts from offense to survival and specialized defense in the Mountains.

---

### 1. Top Priority: Wolf Armor Chest (20 Silver)
* **Level:** 1
* **The Reason:** This provides permanent frost resistance. It is the most important "quality of life" upgrade in the Mountains, freeing up your potion slots for Healing or Stamina meads.
* **Stop at Level 1:** The base armor jump is the goal; don't sink more silver into levels yet.

### 2. Shield: Silver Shield (15 Silver)
* **Level:** 2 or 3 (Total ~30 Silver)
* **The Reason:** For a player who relies on the **Shield Parry** technique, this is essential. A Level 3 Silver Shield can parry a 2-star Wolf or a Fenring.
* **Investment:** Spend the extra silver to reach Level 3. It is your primary insurance policy against high-damage enemies.

### 3. The Weapon: Upgrade Frostner (15 Silver)
* **Level:** 2 (Upgrade Only)
* **The Reason:** You already have the base weapon. Upgrading to Level 2 increases blunt, frost, and spirit damage, making it much more effective against Stone Golems and the undead.

### 4. Utility: Drake Helmet (20 Silver)
* **Level:** 1
* **The Reason:** This provides the highest armor rating for the head slot in this tier. (Requires 2 Drake Trophies).

### Silver Spending Breakdown (90 Ingots)

| Item | Action | Silver Cost | Remaining |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wolf Armor Chest** | Base (Lvl 1) | 20 | 70 |+++
| **Silver Shield** | Base + Upgrades (Lvl 3) | 30 | 40 |
| **Frostner** | Upgrade (Lvl 2) | 15 | 25 |
| **Drake Helmet** | Base (Lvl 1) | 20 | **5** |

> **Grandpa’s Tip:** Avoid the **Fang Spear**—it’s a waste of silver given your playstyle. Save that remaining 5 Silver toward the **Draugr Fang** bow, which will require 10 Silver and Ancient Bark.
