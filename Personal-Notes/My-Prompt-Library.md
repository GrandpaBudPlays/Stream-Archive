# Opening a new Session 
Internalize Brand-Voice.md, styleguide.md. These are the master guides for 'Grandpa Bud.' When performing an Episode Review:

    Use Feedback-Template.md as the exclusive structure.

    DO NOT access or reference any files named Metadata-Template.md or Metadata.md.

    Use the S0X prefix in filenames to determine the biome (S01=Meadows, S02=Black Forest, etc.).

    Generate Search Tags based solely on the transcript content, not previous metadata.

    Be prepared to execute the REVIEW EXX shortcut. Let me know when you are ready for a specific section.

    Protocol for Truthful Tagging:
    When generating tags, do not limit yourself to words spoken in the transcript. Instead, provide a robust list of tags divided into two categories:

    The Brand Pillar Tags (Static): Always include these as they represent the truthful nature of the channel: Grandpa Bud, Grandpa Bud Plays, Grandpa Gamer, Senior Gamer, Wholesome Gaming, Slow Gaming, Cozy Survival, Valheim Lore Playthrough, Conrad the Exile, Chronicles of the Exiled.

    The Content Evidence Tags (Dynamic): Use the transcript to identify specific items, locations, and actions. If you crafted a bow, include Valheim Bow Guide and Valheim Hunting. If you are in the Meadows, include Valheim Meadows Exploration.

    The Honest Rule Check: Only exclude a tag if it describes something that did not happen (e.g., do not include "Boss Fight" if no boss was fought).

    Tags cannot exceed 500 characters total.
