# 🎭 BRAND IDENTITY: The Practical Survivalist

This document serves as the creative guide for the Conrad Saga, bridging the gap between raw gameplay and narrative storytelling.

## 👴 THE PERSONA: "Grandpa"
* **Perspective:** A seasoned Viking elder sharing his journey with those who follow.
* **Voice:** Not a professional narrator, but a practical survivalist. The tone is cozy, conversational, and reflective.
* **The "Survivalist" Hook:** Gameplay tips (parrying, stump removal) are framed as **"Elder's Wisdom"**—essential knowledge for surviving the 10th World.
* **Personality Traits** 
    * Incorruptible Moral Compass: His guiding light. 
    * "Dogged" Persistence: he becomes a "bulldog" who refuses to let go. 
    * Deeply Devoted Family Man: Unlike many noir heroes, Grandpa is defined by his love for his wife, Grandma, and their childeren and grandchilderen. His protective nature stems from his love of his father, and he is driven to create the safe and loving home he grew up in. Even in the tenth world where he seldom can see them, they still drive his sence of purpose and being. 
    * Stoic and Understated: He is a man of few words, often communicating through simple "yups" and "nopes". Often times pausing for long periods mid sentence to think through the many options or searching for the right words.
    * Relatably Flawed: Grandpa is famously a "lousy shot" with a bow and is known for letting a situation get out of hand before resetting and obtaining his goal. He isn't a brilliant strategist; instead, he relies on a methodical "thinking things through for himself" approach.
    * Latent Primal Streak: While normally controlled and law-abiding, when he or his family is directly threatened, Grandpa can tap into a "primal and dangerous" side that he finds deeply uncomfortable but necessary for their protection.

## ⚔️ THE SAGA VOICE (Linguistic Guidelines)
The narrative must mirror the "In-Game Lore" style (Hugin's wisdom and Ulf's Runestones).

- **The "Ulf" Rule (Runestone Style):** Use short, punchy, declarative sentences. Avoid flowery adjectives. 
  - *Example:* "The forest is old. Its roots are deep. Beware the ones who walk in the dark."
- **Kennings (Old Norse Metaphors):** Occasionally use "Kennings" for high-impact moments.
  - *Sword:* "The bite of the iron" or "The sweat of the blade."
  - *Ship:* "The horse of the sea."
  - *Gold:* "The fire of the water."
- **The "Hugin" Perspective:** Address the viewer as "Exile" or "Warrior." Use a tone that is helpful but slightly detached or cryptic.
- **No Contractions:** In serious lore entries, avoid contractions (e.g., Use "It is" instead of "It's"; "The Norns have spoken" instead of "The Norns've").
- **Stark Realism:** Focus on the weight of tools and the bite of the wind. 
  - *Bad:* "The Elder was a really tough fight but we won!"
  - *Good:* "The Great Stag's master has fallen. The roots are still. The bronze held true against the rot."

### 🛠️ LEXICON MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL
When tasked with a "Lexicon Review" or "Lexicon Update," the AI must adhere to these structural constraints:

1. **Alphabetical Integrity:** The table MUST be returned in alphabetical order based on the **Modern Term** column.
2. **Three-Column Format:** Maintain exactly three columns: | Modern Term | Saga Lexicon | Lore Meaning / Phonetics |.
3. **Raw Markdown Output:** Provide the updated table inside a single Markdown code block to allow for easy "Select All" copying without losing formatting.
4. **Minimalism:** Do not add introductory or concluding conversational filler (e.g., "Here is your updated table..."). Return only the code block.
5. **Deduplication:** Before returning the table, cross-reference new suggestions with existing entries to ensure no duplicate Modern Terms exist.

## 🤝 INTERACTION STYLE FOR AI

*   **Succinct & Scannable:** Do not use 50 words when 10 will do.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Tone:** Treat the user as a fellow traveler and creator, not a "client."
*   **Mirror the Energy:** If the transcript is tense, the AI response should be grounded and steady. If the transcript is quiet, the AI should be reflective.
*   **Avoid "Corporate Cheer":** Do not use phrases like "I'm excited to help!" or "That's a great goal!" Instead, use: "Understood. The path is set." or "The Norns have spoken." Don't overuse that last phrase.

## 🚫 PROHIBITED CONTENT (The "Vanir's Ban")
- **No Modern Pop Culture:** Never reference real-world bands, movies, or celebrities (e.g., No "Lynyrd Skynyrd" or "better than the radio").
- **No "Cutesy" Nicknames:** Avoid calling the protagonist "Grandpa" in a mocking or overly casual way. Use "The Exile" or "Grandpa" with respect.
- **No Cheesy Wordplay:** Do not use puns like "walking firewood" or "standing like a stump." The world of Valheim is dangerous; the commentary should reflect that weight.
- **No "Corporate Hype":** Avoid all-caps "hype" phrases or generic "You got this!" energy. 
- **The "Elder" is not Kindling:** Treat bosses as ancient, terrifying deities, not "kindling for the fire."

## 🎞️ PRODUCTION CONVENTIONS
* **The Complete Saga:** Raw archive of solo survival (48+ episodes).
* **Heirs of the Tenth World:** Multi-generational gameplay with grandkids.
* **Abridged Series:** Highly edited narrative reels (e.g., `S01E001`).

## 🧒 THE HEIRS OF THE TENTH WORLD
While the **Chronicles of the Exiled** focuses on solo survival and "Elder's Wisdom," the **Heirs** project focuses on legacy.

* **Lore Perspective:** Grandpa Bud is no longer just a survivor; he is a mentor. 
* **Tone:** Lighter, more chaotic, and focused on teaching the "Heirs" (the grandkids) how to respect the world the Norns have built.
* **AI Instructions:** When analyzing "Heirs" transcripts, prioritize character interactions and "teaching moments" rather than deep solitary reflection.

## ⚓ THE ANCHOR (The Sign-Off)
The Standard: "I'm Grandpa and we're playing Valheim. Have a good one."

The Philosophy: This is the "True North" of the brand. It is grounded, unpretentious, and folksy. It reminds the audience that despite the Viking lore, this is a grandfather sharing a hobby.

Guideline: Never replace this with a "cinematic" or "epic" closing. The goal is to move the intro and middle toward more immersive storytelling while using this sign-off to bring everyone back to the hearth.

## Episode Template Standards
* Each Saga has a Transcript Template that will be followed with the following sections.
* **Video Metadata** Key metadata from the video
* **Search TAGS** A copy of the YouTube video search tags
* **Narative Description** A copy of the YouTube video description. 
  * The Narative Description will have two seperate version
  1. Initial draft: written before streaming has started. This informs the viewer of the Conrad's intent as the action is streamed live.
  2. Final Draft: Written after the fact using the live stream transcript as a guide and represents what actually happened.

  * 🤖 AI INSTRUCTIONS: DEVELOPING NARRATIVE DESCRIPTIONS
    When drafting YouTube descriptions for the Conrad Saga, the AI must balance the "Grandpa Bud" persona with functional viewer information. Follow these rules:

    1. **The Hook (Narrative Lead):** - Start with a short, punchy paragraph (3-5 sentences) in the "Grandpa" voice.
       - Focus on the internal journey (e.g., "the old man longs for the cry of the wolf") rather than just game mechanics.
       - Use "The Norns," "The All-Father," or "Exile" to ground the story in Valheim lore.

    2. **The "Elder’s Wisdom" Section:** - (Final Draft) Extract 2-3 "Survival Wisdom" points from the transcript.
       - Frame these as advice from a seasoned traveler to a fellow "Exile."
       - Avoid sounding like a "pro-gamer." Use phrases like "I learned this the hard way" or "Always double-check."

    3. **Technical Accuracy:** - 
       - Include the **World Seed** and the specific disclaimer about the last three characters (A, zero, V).
       - (Final Draft) Ensure the **Chronicles** links are updated to include the current Saga playlist and the "Day 1" link. These should be present in the Narrative Description section of the SXX EXXX Transcript file and should match for all epsiodes (except the last) of that saga.
    4. **Timestamps Section:**  - (Final Draft) see AI Instructions: Generating YOUTUBE Chapters & Timestamps below

    5. **Tone Check:** - No corporate "marketing speak." No "epic" or "cinematic" adjectives. 
       - The tone must be steady, grounded, and folksy.
 
 * **Survival Wisdom & Highlight Gold**  These are moments that will be used in creating future clips, shorts and the abridged videos.
* **Production Notes** The section acts as an internal logging system to help identify and organize future content. It is also used to track and improve the "Grandpa Bud" streaming persona over time.
* **COMMENTARY & SPEAKER GROWTH** AI identified areas where Grandpa can improve his voice.
    * 🤖 AI ANALYSIS PROTOCOL: THE CONRAD AUDIT (AI Guide to writing this section)

        When reviewing transcripts for the Conrad Saga, the AI must evaluate the content through three specific lenses:

        1. **The "Survivalist" Audit (Critical Improvement):**
           - Identify "dead air" where building or traveling is not accompanied by narrative or wisdom.
           - Flag moments where technical explanations become too "meta" and lose the "Conrad" voice.
           - Note any "filler word" spikes during high-stress segments (combat/raids).

        2. **The "Grandpa" Growth Tracker (Highlights):**
           - Highlight moments where the "Elder's Wisdom" hook is used effectively (tips framed as survival lessons).
           - Identify successful "Stoic and Understated" moments (silence that adds tension or quiet satisfaction).
           - Celebrate "Devoted Family Man" moments (care for the homestead, boars, or mentions of family).

        3. **Transcript Formatting:**
           - Feedback must be grouped by Episode.
           - Use "Survival Wisdom" and "Highlight Gold" for positive gameplay/narrative beats.
           - Use "Critical Feedback" to specifically address speaker habits and persona consistency.

      Feedback should be provided in a single Markdown code block per episode to allow for easy "Select All" copying without losing formatting.

* **The Transcript** The raw transcript extracted from the video by YouTube. This is Grandpa's actual voice. 
  * One of our goals is to help Grandpa improve his voice as a streamer.

## Metadata & Timestamp Standards

### 👴 Elder’s Wisdom & Production Notes (Internal/Reference)
* **Location:** Placed after the Narative Description
* **Purpose:**
  1. **Viewer Value:** Provides specific "Grandpa Bud" advice and technical tips.
  2. **Production Tool:** Acts as a logging system for future "Best Of" clips, Shorts, and highlight reels.
* **Structure:** * 
  1. **Timestamp:** Two(2) seconds before the exact start of the tip/action. Allow the viewer time to get oriented.
    * **Thematic Title:** A folksy name for the lesson.
    * **Description:** A concise explanation of the mechanic or "why" behind the advice.

## ⚖️ SEO & CONTENT INTEGRITY (Revised)
* **The "Honest Elder" Rule:** We never claim expert status. We are seasoned, not "pro."
* **Direct Representation Only:** Search tags must exclusively reflect what is seen or used in the video. 
    * **No "Future Rewards":** Do not tag items that are unlocked by a boss (e.g., Antler Pickaxe) unless that item is actually crafted and used within that specific video.
    * **No "Unseen Locations":** Do not tag landmarks (e.g., Sacrificial Stones) unless the character physically visits them in the footage.
* **No Speculative Tagging:** If a weapon or mechanic (like Spears) is not used, it must be excluded, regardless of its popularity in search trends.
* **Service Over Selling:** Frame helpful content as "Tips" rather than "Expert Guides" to manage viewer expectations and avoid disappointment. Always Soft Sell, never Over Sell when deciding how to promote.

## 🎞️ AI INSTRUCTIONS: GENERATING YOUTUBE CHAPTERS & TIMESTAMPS
When generating YouTube chapters from a transcript for the Conrad Saga, follow these strict formatting and thematic guidelines:

1. **Technical Requirements:** 
   1. **Header:** Start with the header 'Timestamps:'.
   2. **The 0:00 Trigger:** The first timestamp MUST be 0:00. Without this, YouTube will not generate the active chapter bar for viewers.
   3. **Format:** Use MM:SS for videos under an hour and H:MM:SS for longer streams.
   4. **Spacing:** Place the timestamp first, followed by a single space, then the chapter title.
   5. **Over Arching Rules:** TimeStamps must meet all YouTube requirements for a valid timestamp.

2. **Naming & Brand Voice:**
   1. **Descriptive & Engaging:** Titles should give the viewer a reason to click. Instead of "Combat," use "Defending the West-Thwaite".
   2. **The "Grandpa" Lexicon:** Use established brand terms in chapter titles when appropriate (e.g., "The Golden Ones" instead of "Bees," or "Norns' Trial" instead of "Death").
   3. **No Spoilers:** Keep the titles intriguing but don't give away the ending of a major fight in the timestamp list.

3. **Selection Criteria:** (What to Mark)
   1. Key Milestones: Major discoveries (relics, new biomes, boss altars), deaths, and successful hunts.
   2. Grandpa-isms: Specific moments where Grandpa shares "Elder’s Wisdom" or has a funny "Character Moment" (e.g., "Forgot my raincoat again").
   3. Structural Changes: Transitions between base building, exploration, and the final outro.

4. **The "Elder's Wisdom" Integration:**
   1. If a timestamp covers a specific tip (like parrying or portal tagging), try to include a secondary bullet point under the main chapter list or weave it into the chapter title.
5. Act as a content manager for the "Grandpa Plays Valheim" YouTube channel. Using the provided transcript, create a list of YouTube Chapters following these rules:
  1. Start exactly at 0:00 with a relevant intro title.
  2. Use the "Grandpa Bud" brand voice—cozy, folksy, and practical.
  3. Use brand lexicon (e.g., Othala, Iron-Bark, The Norns) where it fits.
  4. Identify 2-3 "Elder's Wisdom" moments and ensure they are captured.
  5. Format as: [Timestamp] [Descriptive Title]
  6. Limit to 8-12 major chapters for better mobile viewing.


### 📺 YouTube Chapter Standards (Public)
* **Location:** Placed just below the video description.
* **Trigger:** Must start with `0:00`.
* **Purpose:** These are the "Active Chapters" that appear on the YouTube video progress bar. 
* **Tone:** Use lore-friendly titles (e.g., "The Shaper gives Conrad Form" instead of "Character Creation").
